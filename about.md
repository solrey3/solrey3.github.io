I'm a DevOps engineer and data scientist specializing in multi-cloud infrastructure, data analytics, and enterprise-scale system design. I build and maintain critical infrastructure that powers modern applications while developing intelligent systems that solve complex business problems.

## **Professional Focus**

Currently working with multi-cloud infrastructure as a software engineering consultant, where I manage Kubernetes deployments across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. My work involves maintaining 99.9% uptime for high-traffic applications, implementing security best practices, and coordinating complex release management processes.

I specialize in bridging the gap between traditional operations and modern cloud-native architectures, with particular expertise in containerization, infrastructure as code, and automated deployment pipelines.

## **Technical Expertise**

**Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform  
**Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Docker, Container Security  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Helm  
**Programming Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Bash  
**Data Engineering:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, ETL Pipelines  
**Database Systems:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB  
**Web Technologies:** Flask, Laravel, WordPress, Nginx  
**Operating Systems:** Linux (Multiple Distributions), MacOS 
**Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, LGTM Stack 

## **Current Projects**

**AI-Driven Systems:** Developing intelligent assistant applications that integrate with enterprise workflows and personal productivity systems.

**Music Technology:** Building sophisticated audio streaming infrastructure with advanced metadata management and discovery algorithms.

**Sports Analytics:** Creating predictive models for NBA performance analysis using machine learning and statistical modeling.

**Infrastructure Automation:** Designing privacy-first, self-hosted solutions for personal and small business cloud infrastructure.

## **Professional Philosophy**

I believe in building systems that are secure, scalable, and maintainable. My approach emphasizes automation, documentation, and sustainable practices that enable teams to move fast without breaking things.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and infrastructure operations, exploring how machine learning can enhance monitoring, prediction, and automated response systems.

## **Technical Interests**

- **Privacy-First Computing:** Self-hosted solutions and decentralized systems
- **Multi-Cloud Strategy:** Vendor-agnostic infrastructure design
- **AI/ML Operations:** MLOps practices and intelligent automation
- **Cultural Technology:** Building systems that serve diverse global communities
