# Recap of The B.S. Report's NBA 2013-2014 Wins Over-Unders

So I just finished listening to the BS Report's Over/Unders for NBA Team Wins for this season.  I always appreciate catching this before everything starts rolling.  So the image shows the team with the Vegas Over/Under line and what the Sports Guy and House picked.  Locks are highlighted.

As for where there is disagreement, I'm taking the ATL with the under, SAC with the under, DAL with the under, and HOU with the over.  Also, I'm riding the bandwagon and have GS as an over.  I do agree with the locks.
